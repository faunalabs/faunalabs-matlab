Dave Haas, earned his PhD in Marine Science and Conservation at
Duke University and Duke University Marine Lab. He is a National Geographic 
Explorer and former NSF Graduate Resaerch Fellow. His research
focuses on describing the physiological dive response in cetaceans
using a multi-sensor digital archival tag called the FaunaTag. Developed
by Mr. Haas and his collaborators, the FaunaTag was recently
field-tested during a series of breath-hold trials involving bottlenose
dolphins. Results from these trials have demonstrated the FaunaTagâ€™s
bio-optical and kinematic sensors are capable of non-invasively
measuring cardio-pulmonary and hemodynamic patterns in these animals.
Additional trials involving the FaunaTag are planned for a number of wild
cetaceans in 2022, and testing to assess its suitability for use with 
terrestrial species is also planned. Prior to completing his PhD, Dave 
served as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of Worldwide
Game Studios at PopCap, the makers of Bejeweled and Plants vs. Zombies.
